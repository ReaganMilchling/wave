This is a project I made in High School using Java in Processing. This was made after the spaceflight game. We were allowed to make any kind of game we wanted, following a few rules (as I remember correcty). 
We needed to have user input, include static images, and we must have two animations (hence the torches and the cat).

None of the artwork or sound is my own, I just edited and pixelized high resolution pictures to fit the theme.

This project taught me a lot about programming and OOP. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement. The game logic needs to rehauled and I want to add in more enemys.
I have slowly been converting this project into eclipse so that I can get rid of all the hanging functions and put them in one class while setting up a real time loop, rather than processing's built in function.
